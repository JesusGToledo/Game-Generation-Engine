Developed a procedurally generated world simulation, similar to games like Terraria or Dwarf Fortress.
Used Perlin noise and recursive division algorithms to create realistic terrain features.
Designed an interactive player-controlled environment with exploration mechanics, random structures, and AI-driven movement.
Optimized world storage with quadtrees and chunk-based memory management for scalability.
